# Influenza-Season-Interim-Report
# Summary
This report is to help a medical staffing agency prepare for flu season by analyzing trends, merging data sources, and conducting statistical tests to predict staffing needs across clinics and hospitals. This report covers hypothesis, data quality, integration, analysis, and actionable insights.
# Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis 1:The elderly age group (65+) death by influenza is equal to or less than  deaths in adults (25-64).
Alternative Hypothesis 1: The elderly age group (65+) death by influenza is more than adults (25-64).
Null Hypothesis 2: The young children (5 years or less) death by influenza is equal to or less than  deaths in adults (25-64).
Alternative Hypothesis 2: The number of young children (5 years or less) dying by influenza is more than adults (25-64).
Significance Level: 0.05
# Results
Both P-values for each hypothesis statistical testing was enough with a 95% confidence to reject both null hypothesis. This insight shows that states with a high young children and elderly population are being impacted due to influenza. The next steps is to utilize visualization programs such as Tablueau to create visuals comparing each state and the young children and elderly population and influenza death rate.
